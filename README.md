With Oracle, here in the place, making its GraalVM and Java scripts removed from currents releases (Java 9+), I can not make a good Feuille, that's why I tried GraalVM but it is aligned at Java 8 (only Nashorn as Javascript now JSR223 is dropped). There is also the usage of base drawing that sucks a lot in Java 8 cause it don't uses Harfbuzz. Now current version use it.

To make really something different, and to try quitting Java because Oracle is not ready to offer a real GraalVM with evolution of currents realeases although I love GraalVM for many reasons, I decide to try developing it in C++ using the latest Microsoft Visual Studio Community. But it can be not definitive.
