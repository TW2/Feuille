| Feuille v0.x  | Feuille v2.x |
| ---- | ---- |
| Java 6+ | GraalVM |

The currently version is 2.0, still in coding, since January 2019 and with GraalVM cause JDK11 has no out-to-the-box scripting solutions. If you want to download the GraalVM, you have to register to Oracle because there is no public release for the moment. If you search for previous releases you can find source in test folder and application in releases access (there is also the source). Version 0.x works with Java 6 or higher, I suggest you to open it with command line (java -jar Feuille.jar in your chosen directory where you had download and/or move it). In Windows, the application works great in command line. Notice that there is no more JRE! To work with recent configuration, you have to download a JDK. And configure your PATH.
